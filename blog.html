        <p>I'm Chino Engallado, 22 years old and currently taking BSIT Network Administration, a 4th year student.</p>
        <p>So, why did I take this course? First of all it is on my personal interest where at early age I have been engaged with technology.</p>
        <p>Where for me there is no course that is easy, where it needs hardwork and also the interest with the course itself.</p>
